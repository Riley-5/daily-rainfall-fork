### Background
There is a significant difference in the density of weather stations between provinces in South Africa. As can be seen from the map below provinces such as the Western Cape have substanitally more weather stations allowing for grater monitoring and data collection than provinces such as the Northern Cape.

There is already an interest in rainfall as seen by the Reenval in SA Facebook group. However, the data uploaded to this Facebook group does not get saved to a single database and nobody can easily access this data. To address this issue, this web application, [uprain.co.za](https://uprain.co.za/), was devloped were a user can login, register, upload data, and view the data on a web map. The data uploaded by a user will get saved in a Google Firebase database. 

The aim is that users will login daily at 08h00 and upload the amount of rainfall they have recieved since 08h00 from the previous day. 
Please note that the rainfall is a 24h accumulation running from 08h00 to 08h00.
