### Background

There is already an interest in Rainfall as seen by the Reenval in SA Facebook group. However, the data uploaded does not get saved to a single database and nobody can easilly access this data. To address this issue, this web application, [uprain.co.za](https://uprain.co.za/) was devloped were a user can login, register, upload data, and view the data on a web map. The data uploaded by a user will get saved in a Google Firebase database. 

The aim is that users will login daily at 08h00 and upload the amount of rainfall they have recieved. 
Please note that the rainfall is a 24h accumulation running from 08h00 to 08h00.
