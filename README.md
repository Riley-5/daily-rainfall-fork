# Daily Rainfall

### Background
There is a significant difference in the density of weather stations between provinces in South Africa. This results in some provinces having substanitally more rainfall monitoring and data collection than others.

As shown in the above image the Western Cape has a far greater density of weather stations than the Northern Cape. 

There is already an interest in Rainfall as seen by the Reenval in SA Facebook group. However, The data uploaded does not get saved to a single database and nobody can easilly access this data. 

To address this a web application was devloped were a user can login, register, upload data, and view the data on a web map. 

The aim is that users will login daily at 08h00 and upload the amount of rainfall they have recieved. 
Please note that the rainfall is a 24h accumulation running from 08h00 to 08h00.
